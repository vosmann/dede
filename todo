1. Modularize python code.
2. Add decent logging.
3. Set up build that minifies and obfuscates JS _and_ python code.
4. Make a nice, basic, centered layout, based on bootstrap, that is easily extendable with less/sass.
5. Fix the renaming thing: have a "project id" field and separate "project name" and a separate "url" field.
   - Allow slashes in the project name. A separate url will then _not_ allow them. -> Add a regex check before anything
     is stored.


A] Make sense of the JS build lanscape (Bower and RequireJS for dependencies, Grunt for build tasks...)
   and Python builders (like zc.buildout).
B] Make a nice build process that minifies+obfuscates JS and compiles (and obfuscates?) Python.
C] Make Docker images with these build products.
