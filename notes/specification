Functional requirements:

* Site needs to have:
    * front page will show a selection of recent projects (e.g. 20% of them)
    * archive section with the remaining 80% of the projects.
    * about page
    * contacts page
    * newsfeed page

* sidebar with all the names of the projects; main box contains pictures of 
  projects. maybe the sidebar is not really necessary. the names of the projects
  can also be right under the picture.
* when on an individual project's page, there can be a sidebar with the names
  of all the other projects. these can be some harmonica js/bootstrap elements
  that unfold and fold when clicked. if focused on a project from the "current"
  group, then only that group should be unfolded in the sidebar (archive should
  be folded) and also vice-versa when focused on a project from the archive.
  these should only contain the current and archived projects from the selected
  category.
* when on a project page, maybe have a twitter link/icon
* when you hover over a picture, the name of that project in the sidebar should
  be highlighted. same when you hover over a project name.
* when hovering over a project in the front page, its name can also be shown in
  a tool-tip (maybe together with its category)
* one way to filter by category is to gray out all projects belonging to other
  categories, but perhaps it's better to only show the category's projects.
* the layout can be the fuzzy one with a different number of projects pics in
  every row and column, but perhaps it would be better to keep it
  grid-organized.
* a simple one-project-per-row like on playgroundparis.com may be better for the
  frontpage/project list page.
* widmanski also has a nice layout. always two project per row, centered around
  an axis in the middle. one of the projects (pictures) in a row is big and one
  is small, alternating. in the last row, there are two small ones.


* category filter on top (graphic design, photography, motion, illustration)
* maybe two pics per project can be selected as "headline pics" so that a hover
  over the pic on the project produces a flip to the second picture.
* responsive! should change when the window resizes or when viewed on other
  devices.

* in the focused project, the text description should be either always visible
  (on the side) or put underneath the first picture - not always at the end,
  i.e. after all the pictures. 

* see if i can serve all images in a single json or better to have multiple
  rest calls to load the images one by one.

Technical requirements:

* cache all project info, news stories, etc. and images in memory.
* back button should always work
* ctrl+click (open in a new tab) should always work
