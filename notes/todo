BUG: back button on project page doesn't work

BUG: not scrolling all the way up when selecting entry from entries' main page.

FEATURE: Make renaming projects easy: have a "project id" field and separate "project name" and a separate "url" field.
         - Allow slashes in the project name. A separate url will then _not_ allow them. -> Add a regex check before 
         anything is stored.

FEATURE: enable google crawler to index all the content.

1. Modularize python code.
2. Add decent logging.
# TODO sanitize login inputs (user & pass).

4. Make a nice, basic, centered layout, based on bootstrap, that is easily extendable with less/sass.

# Set up non-root users for supervisor, gunicorn, mongo, etc.

C] Make Docker images with these build products.
# I should probably make a nice docker image with ubuntu, https set up, supervisor & gunicorn installed,
# python, mongo... and then maybe dynamically append an image that would just copy some 
# private keys/certificates

proper JS build procedure that downloads and includes latest angular and other libs.
maybe use 
#   - browserify.js,
#   - require.js or
#   - webpack

FEATURE: # Maybe have a special (only when authenticated) interface that serves some page
         # or entry even if it is hidden. So that the user can preview a new page or entry
         # before he really shows it on the live site.

FEATURE: CSS style dropdowns for all text elements (title, text etc.)
         Have the edit app parse the CSS and automatically offer class names in a drop-down for text and title elements.
         These classes could have some prefixing naming convention.

FEATURE: renameable tags: Should keep _id *and* display name so that the latter can be changed.

# Reduce amount of redundant conversions from json/dicts to objects and vice-versa.
# The idea behind using the objects is to give some structure to the domain entities and to not do
# too much dirty work with dicts everywhere.

# Cache these in their Python object form: page ids, page names, all page views
# The cache could never expire (maybe like every 2-3 hours, but it should be invalidated when edits are made.

# It would be awesome if adding pages like "projects" or "news stories" on the 
# edit page would generate the AngularJS controllers automatically.



========================
DONE
========================

A] Make sense of the JS build lanscape (Bower and RequireJS for dependencies, Grunt for build tasks...)
   and Python builders (like zc.buildout).
   - Maybe having a shell script to do these steps is good enough.
   - Grunt+RequireJS seems to work for Goekhan.

B] Make a nice build process that minifies+obfuscates JS and compiles (and obfuscates?) Python.

3. Set up build that minifies and obfuscates JS _and_ python code.

# Use nginx as a proxy for gunicorn
