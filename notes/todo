TODO
========================


FEATURE: Make renaming projects easy: have a "project id" field and separate "project name" and a separate "url" field.
         - Allow slashes in the project name. A separate url will then _not_ allow them. -> Add a regex check before 
         anything is stored.

FEATURE: Enable google crawler to index all the content, e.g. run prerender.io.

FEATURE: Special (only when authenticated) interface that serves a page
         or entry even if it is hidden. For user preview of a new page or entry
         before it gets shown on production.

FEATURE: Renameable tags: Should keep _id *and* display name so that the latter can be changed. In a separate tab in
         the editing interface.

FEATURE: Separate tab for editing images in the editing interface.


- Modularize python code.
- Add logging.
- Sanitize login credential input.
- Make a nice, basic, centered layout, based on bootstrap, that is easily extendable with less/sass.
  Generalize the AngularJS code.

- Set up less privileged users for supervisor, gunicorn, mongo, etc.
- Make Docker image with everything installed and configured.

- Improve JS build procedure: download, include, build latest libs.
- Look into using browserify.js, require.js and webpack.
- Consider zc.buildout should the need arise.

- Reduce amount of redundant json/dicts-to-object and vice-versa conversions.
  But keep working with objects that represent abstract domain entities and avoid too much dirty work with dicts.

- Add more caching where necessary. Perhaps page ids, page names, all page views etc.
  The cache could have a very long lifetime, but must get invalidated after edits are made.

- Remove hard-coded basic redirect location url from viewApps.js.

- Cut edit-index.html into smaller html files.
